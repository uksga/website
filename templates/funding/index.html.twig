                The Student Government Association offers much funding and resources to serve the entire student body. 
                This scholarship is intended to reimburse the costs and fees of only graduate and professional students remotely attending a professional and/or leadership development event. 
                In the past, this scholarship was to help fund travel to in-person events, however, due to current COVID-19 safety precautions, we will only provide financial assistance for events with remote attendance until the University of Kentucky has deemed it safe to travel. 
                This application seeks to validate that applicants will be in attendance and have/will register for an event that will enhance the studentâ€™s leadership, professionalism, academics and/or career. 
                The scholarship takes form as reimbursement of receipts provided by the recipient; therefore, while applicants do not need to register before applying for the grant, recipients must register and pay prior to receiving the grant money. 
                Applicants may apply for this grant to receive up to $1,000 of their expenses for future events or events on/after January 4th, 2021. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Academic and Student Affairs Chair at sga.studentaffairs@uky.edu.
