        <p class="description u-margin-bottom-small">The Wildcat Wardrobe accepts nearly new, contemporary professional attire in all sizes for men and women. All career appropriate clothing donations MUST be laundered/dry-cleaned and ready to wear <u>on hangers only</u>. <u>No bags or boxes please</u>. <u>Shoes and jewelry can be put in bins</u>. No donations should be in need of repair and <u>no clothing items that haven’t been purchased in the last 5 years</u>. Due to limited space in the Wardrobe, we want to ensure that we are providing college students with contemporary clothing in their pursuits for success. Focusing on these essential items will allow our team to maintain safety while continuing to meet our students changing needs.</p>
        <p class="description">If you would like to make a donation, please email sga.wardrobe@uky.edu with the date and time you are planning to drop off the clothing. The drop off location is in the Student Government Office, Suite A267 in the Gatton Student Center from 10-5pm Monday-Friday.</p>
