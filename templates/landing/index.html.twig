                Fellow Students and Campus Community,
                <br><br>
                Welcome to our website and thank you so much for your interest in the University of Kentucky 
                Student Government Association. UKSGA’s mission is to serve each and every student. Our goal 
                is to ensure you are being represented, advocated for, and that you feel the sense of belonging 
                to which every Wildcat deserves. As your elected representatives from across campus, we strive 
                to engage with the student body in order to guarantee the feedback we provide to 
                administrators is not only accurate, but also matches the pulse of campus. 
                <br><br>
                We invite you to explore and utilize our many services during your time as a student. Whether it 
                be the Wildcat Wardrobe, legal services, or our countless number of grant opportunities – we 
                want to make sure you have easy access to the services you are entitled to. 
                <br><br>
                Finally, I encourage you to get involved! We have a great team of passionate leaders, but we can 
                always benefit from new perspectives. Change cannot be made on campus without the tireless 
                work of our student body. Run to be a senator or executive member in our spring general 
                election, apply to be a director or coordinator, or just stay in touch and share with us your 
                passions and/or concerns! 
                <br><br>
                With any additionally questions or concerns feel free to contact us by phone (859-257-3191), by email (SGA.President@uky.edu) or stopping by our office (Gatton Student Center Room A267).
